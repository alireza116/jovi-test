## Abstract {.unnumbered}

All JoVI articles begin with a structured abstract. See **TODO** for guidance and a template for the abstract.

## Setting up and writing a JoVI article

JoVI articles are written in Quarto, which is a simple markdown-based text format. This template outlines some of the features that are most useful for writing academic articles in Quarto; for more visit <https://quarto.org>.

You can find the source for this article in the [journalovi/jovi-template-quarto](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto) repository on Github. To create a new JoVI article, we recommend following these steps:

1.  Install Quarto by following [these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html).

2.  Create a new git repository to hold your article by [forking our template repository](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto).

You can then edit `index.qmd` in your new repository to write your paper. There are several options for editing and rendering the paper:

1.  You can execute `quarto serve` from the commandline to render the paper to `index.html` and preview it in the browser.

2.  You can edit the paper in RStudio and render it by clicking on the *Render* button: ![](images/rstudio-render-button.png){style="max-width: 382.5px" fig.alt="Click Render in the Rstudio toolbar to render a Quarto document."}

**If you plan to use RStudio,** read more about RStudio and Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/using-rstudio.html). In particular, you should install RStudio \> version 1.5, which as of this writing requires installing the [latest "daily" version of RStudio](https://dailies.rstudio.com/). If you do, you can also enable the visual editor:

![](images/rstudio-visual-editor.png){style="max-width: 554.5px" fig.alt="Click the Settings button and then Use Visual Editor in the Rstudio toolbar to enable the visual editor."}

## Citations and footnotes

Citations can be inserted using `[@simkin2002read]`; e.g. \[@simkin2002read\]. Citations for this paper are kept in `bibliography.bib` in BibTeX format.[^1] For more on footnotes and citations see [this Quarto documentation page](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).

[^1]: You can also insert footnotes!

## Figures and images

Images can be included and for accessibility purposes **should always** have alt text. Alt text of visualizations should provide meaningful descriptions of the visualization.

``` markdown
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions,
showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of
approximately 97% of optimal."}
```

![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions, showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of approximately 97% of optimal."}

You can also add captions and figure references using a `:::` block combined with an id prefixed with `#fig-`:

``` markdown
:::
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions,
showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of
approximately 97% of optimal."}

Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions.
:::
```

::: {#fig-teaser}
![](images/teaser.svg){fig.alt="Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions, showing an increase over time in most conditions, with dot50 having the highest value of approximately 97% of optimal."}

Mean expected payoff / optimal payoff for 10 conditions.
:::

Then you can refer to the above figure in text using `@fig-teaser`; for example:

Refer to @fig-teaser. For the highest-quality output, we recommend using SVG figures if possible.

Quarto also supports more complex figure layouts and subfigures; see [the Quarto page on figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures-and-layout.html). For more on cross-references, see the [Quarto page on cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).

## Code

Quarto supports R and python code; for example:

```{r}
1 + 2
```

## Equations

Equations can be included using LaTeX syntax:

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

For more on equations, see [the corresponding section in the Quarto documentation]().
